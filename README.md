# Encrypt data example
Shows how to encrypt data held in public space

The example data is from my Master's thesis. You can obtain all the details at the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/richarddmorey/absoluteJudgmentCalibration

Here, I've only used the minimum content needed for a working example.

What am I assuming?

* You would like to save data in a online repository for convenience, safety, and potential future sharing
* You would like to keep these data private for a time
* You'd like to easily share the data with colleagues/editors/reviewers, even though they are private
* You don't need heavy-duty security/encryption
* You analyze data in R

If these are true, this example is for you.
